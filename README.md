# Personal and academic projects

In this section, I highlight the projects in which I had practical experience in the tools I intend to use in my career and systems that development required the application 
of engineering methods learned during my undergraduate.

Firstly, here is a list of some small projects I developed or helped to develop:

- [Brother in ARM](https://github.com/brunoVA101/lab-proc) : Web GDB client for an ARM architechture
- [Devcontainer study](https://github.com/hfduran/devcontainer) : Study of Docker and Devcontainers for implementing on [USPolis project](#uspolis-classroom-allocation-system-for-universities)
- [Just Coding!](http://github.com/hfduran/just-coding): Repository dedicated to study and research new programming languages and techniques

## [USPolis](https://www.uspolis.com.br): Classroom allocation system for universities

[Backend repo](https://github.com/PCS-Poli-USP/USPolis-DB-Migration)

[Frontend repo](https://github.com/PCS-Poli-USP/USPolis-Admin-Frontend)

An system for allocating classes and events to classrooms on a building. Currently implemented and working on buildings of POLI-USP, it has an administrative web interface for the secretaries to manage all the scheduling and allocations, and a mobile app for the students to check which classroom should they go. Specially helpfull on the start of the semesters, when all the classrooms must be allocated for the first time, and the students do not previously know their classrooms.

Some key features I developed on the system:
- Full backend and database refactoring
- Conflict checking for allocations
- Allocate a same class on different days and classrooms
- User managing and authentication flow

### Key Learnings:
- Database design
- Software architechture
- Python frameworks for backend
- Clean code
- Deployment of web applications

## Jewie: jewerly store management software

[repository](https://github.com/hfduran/jewie)

This is a personal project I started in order to learn both Class Modeling and Software Architechture implemented to a Desktop software. The reason is that I always wanted to develop a Desktop software, since I had much more contact and experience with Web Development, and I happen to know quite well about the business logic of a jewerly store. With that in mind, I realized it was a good idea to give it a try, and model a software for that domain.

Therefore, I chose to use Java, since it is a language I did not have much contact before, and is very important in Software Development, with the JavaFX framework.

### Key Learnings:
- Class Modeling
- Software Architechture in Java
- Desktop Application development
- Object Oriented development

## Statistics Studies
[repository](https://github.com/hfduran/statistics)

For the Statistics classes I had on university, me and a friend decided to create a repository to code our lessons, and learn both Statistics and R language.

### Key Learnings:
- Statistics
- R language
- Data Analysis
